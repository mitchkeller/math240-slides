        Suppose that we are making a sandwich. If we have 4 choices for the type of bread and 3 choices for the filling, how many different sandwiches can be made?

  <title>The Bijection Rule</title>
  <slide>
    <title>Using Bijections to Count</title>
    <p>
      Recall from Chapter 4 that a function <m>f\colon S\to T</m> is a <term>bijection</term> provided that <m>f</m> is both one-to-one and onto. Equivalently, <m>f</m> has an <term>inverse</term> <m>f^{-1}\colon T\to S</m> so that for all <m>s\in S</m> and <m>t\in T</m>, <m>f(s)=t</m> if and only if <m>f^{-1}(t) = s</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are finite sets and <m>f\colon S\to T</m> is a bijection, then <m>|S| = |T|</m>.

    <title>Power Set Cardinality</title>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a finite set with <m>|X| = n</m>. The power set <m>P(X)</m> has cardinality <m>|P(X)| = 2^n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p component="a">
      <em>Proof</em>: We will construct a bijection from <m>P(X)</m> to <m>Y = \{0,1\}^n</m>. Let <m>X = \set{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n}</m> and <m>A\subseteq X</m>. Define <m>f\colon P(X) \to Y</m> by
      <me>
        f(A) = y_1y_2\cdots y_n\qquad\text{where}\qquad y_i = 1\text{ if }x_i\in A\text{ and }y_i=0\text{ if }x_i\not\in A
      </me>.
      Notice that we have an inverse <m>f^{-1}(y_1y_2\cdots y_n) = \set{x_i\in X\mid y_i = 1}</m>. Thus, <m>|P(X)| = |Y|=2^n</m> by the bijection rule and product rule.

  </slide>

    <title>The Pigeonhole Principle</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>k\in\Z^+</m>. If <m>k+1</m> or more objects are placed into <m>k</m> boxes, then there is at least one box containing <m>2</m> or more objects.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p component="a">
      The number of handshakes a person can do is in <m>\set{0,1,\dots, N-1}</m>. However, we cannot have both a person with zero handshakes and a person with <m>N-1</m> handshakes. Thus, there are <m>N-1</m> possible values for the number of handshakes a person has done and <m>N</m> people, so there must be (at least) two with the same number.

  </slide>
  <slide>
    <title>Example</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a set of numbers between <m>0</m> and <m>99</m>. What can we say about the size of <m>X</m> if we know that <m>X</m> has two distinct subsets with the same sum?
    </p>
    <p component="a">
      A set of size <m>n</m> will have <m>2^n</m> subsets. The sum of each subset ranges from <m>0</m> to <m>99n</m> (crude bound that could be improved!). Hence, we need <m>2^n \gt 99n+1</m>. Since <m>2^9 = 512</m> while <m>99\cdot 9 +1 = 892</m>, we can see that <m>n=9</m> is not enough to apply the Pigeonhole Principle. However, <m>2^{10} = 1024</m> and <m>99\cdot 10 + 1 = 991</m>. Thus, <m>|X|\geq 10</m>.
